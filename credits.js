    TODO:
    > make pie chart of class distribution
    > also race
    > also gender?? might be kinda pointless but well
    
    > better tooltip with more item info or rather no tooltip but a separate
    area that shows the item details? might be easier to implement + more
    pleasant on the eye
    
    div > show elements when hovering and then hide again when mouseout
    
    item name
    item icon
    + all other data that is retrieved from the API could also be included
    rarity in appropriate color
